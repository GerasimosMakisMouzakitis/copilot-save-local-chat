# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains icon files for the Copilot Chat Saver extension.

Required icon sizes:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent the extension's purpose of saving chat conversations, such as:
- A chat bubble with a save/download arrow
- A document with chat lines
- A combination of the Microsoft Copilot logo and a save icon

For now, you can use simple placeholder icons or create them using online icon generators.

Recommended tools:
- Canva (online)
- GIMP (free)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Online favicon generators

The icons should have a clean, professional look and be clearly visible at small sizes.
